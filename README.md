This is the badge photo and the code I used to decode it. The URL in the purple text was hard to get programatically.
I guessed at the letters I didn't know until I got something that worked.

all-hand.txt is the digits from the badge.  I first used an OCR program to get them all, then hand modified it to ensure correctness. I comma seperated each feild, then made a second value in the same line explaining whcihc color each one was. This could have been done with a better data scturcture, but I really wanted to be able to visualize it while I was working on it.
